Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Key subfields include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks are widely used. Proper data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation are critical to build robust systems for real-world tasks.
